Welcome to My ATM repo
-------------------------------
This repo is a practice repo I am using to solve an ATM chalenge.

Context
-------------------------------
In a small country on the planet Cyber, the current currency is the bit that stands for B $. In this currency there are B $ 50.00, B $ 10.00, B $ 5.00 and B $ 1.00 banknotes. You have been hired to implement the withdrawal system at an ATM and for this you should always release as few notes as possible for a certain amount requested. Your algorithm will have as input the value to be withdrawn from the cashier and should issue the total of each note necessary to compose the requested value (so that this total is the minimum possible).

The Algorithm should be closed when the value to be withdrawn is 0 (zero).

Note: No withdrawal may exceed B $ 1000.00 bits.
